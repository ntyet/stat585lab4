In a world where it was normal not being normal...Gauss was born and things started to change. The Earth all trembeled and the clouds started to move as the there was not enough space in the sky for the sun to show up. But it was not the sun, it was ... Cauchy!!! Hahahaha!

library(ggplot2)

set.seed(2014)
ourdata <- rcauchy(1000)
qplot(ourdata, binwidth=5) + ggtitle("Cauchy data")
```
